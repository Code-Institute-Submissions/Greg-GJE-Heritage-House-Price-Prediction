## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - The dataset is explored to understand its shape, information, and missing values.
   - Visualizations, including box plots, distribution plots, count plots, and bar plots, are utilized to analyze numerical and categorical features.

**2. Data Cleaning and Outlier Handling:**
   - Outliers in the 'LotArea' feature are detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and removed for data integrity.
   - Visualizations are re-examined after outlier removal.

**3. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Categorical features are encoded using Label Encoding.
   - Missing values in categorical variables are imputed with the mode, while numerical features are imputed with the median.
   - The preprocessed data is separated into input features (x) and the target variable (y).

## Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

**1. Model Loading and Testing:**
   - A self-trained XGBoost model from another notebook is saved to directory and is loaded from the 'xgb_r2.pkl' file.
   - Necessary preprocessing steps are applied to the 'test.csv' file for evaluation.

**2. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - GridSearchCV is utilized to find the best hyperparameters for the XGBoost model.
   - The model is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and R2 score to assess its performance.
   - The best model is saved as 'xgb_r2.pkl' for future use.

## Web Application (Streamlit)

**1. User Interface:**
   - Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface for inputting house features.
   - Relevant input fields are provided, allowing users to input information such as floor areas, number of bedrooms, and overall condition.

**2. Prediction:**
   - Upon clicking the 'Predict' button, the user input is processed and passed to the XGBoost model.
   - The predicted house price is displayed to the user.

## Rationale for Data Visualizations and ML Tasks

The data visualizations, including box plots, distribution plots, and bar plots, were chosen to understand the distribution and relationships of numerical and categorical features. These visualizations aid in identifying patterns and outliers in the dataset. Machine learning tasks, such as XGBoost regression, were selected due to their ability to handle regression problems efficiently. XGBoost, with hyperparameter tuning, ensures the model's accuracy in predicting house prices.
